title: "About Me"
---

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. My main fields of interest are labor and macroeconomics.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Analyst at Cornerstone Research in New York City. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago with a double major in economics and mathematics.

In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.rockefeller.uchicago.edu/carillon-recitals-and-tower-tours/" target="_blank"> playing the carillon at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel</a>, exploring Chicago's dining scene, and taking photos of sunsets.
