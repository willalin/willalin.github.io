title: "About Me"
---

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. My main fields of interest are labor and macroeconomics.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com" target="_blank"> Cornerstone Research</a>. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago with a double major in economics and mathematics.

In my free time, I enjoy performing as a <a href="https://www.rockefeller.uchicago.edu/carillon-recitals-and-tower-tours/" target="_blank"> student Carillonist at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel</a>, exploring Chicago's dining scene (see my top recs <a href="https://willa-lin.notion.site/My-Favorite-Chicago-Restaurants-ea295d1b3d70459bb1b5e9008d34cb98" target="_blank"> here</a>), and taking photos of sunsets.
